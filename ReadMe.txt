This repository is for my attempts at solving https://projecteuler.net problems.

DO NOT CHEAT! CHEATING IS NOT THE POINT HERE.

-Each problem is in its own folder; the name of the folder corresponding to the 
problem ID on the website.

-There should be a copy of the problem in problem#.txt file,
in the corresponding folder (of course).
